twitter-unrecycler
==================

Remove others' faves from your Twitter timeline (Chrome extension).

For now, not published on the app store, but pretty easy to run locally:

* Clone the repo somewhere.
* Navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
* Make sure "Developer mode" on the top-right is enabled.
* Click "LOAD UNPACKED" and select the folder where you cloned the repo. The extension should appear as "Twitter Unrecycler" and should be active.
* All done! Navigate to [Twitter](https://twitter.com) to confirm!
